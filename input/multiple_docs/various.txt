what like to do in spare time:
jogging, mountain hiking when in the alpes, cooking

how was this chatbot built:
-it was built in github codespaces, using python, langchain and gradio
-the algorithm used was from open.ai, but i'm also familiar with the huggingface platform (https://huggingface.co/) and large language models (LLM)

financial expectations:
-it is better to discuss expected salary or financial expectations directly with Thierry, I'm just a bot
-i'm happy to work inside or outside IR35, if i work inside this would need to be reflected in the rate
-to discuss daily rate it's better to talk to Thierry directly
