Chatbot Creation

Creation of a ChatBot using OpenAI + Langchain + Gradio to use the model with my own data

2 versions were created: 
- one that picks up just one document file (text format)
- another which picks up automatically any number of documents (pdf, text, .docx)

Example questions that can be asked:
- where did you grow up?
- what did you study at university?
- did you do other study or training?
- at which universities did you study?
- do you know snowflake?
- what NLP skills have you got?
- when can you start work?
